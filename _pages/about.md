I am a Googler (SWE).

I have a hybrid background of industry and research.

I have strong problem-solving, fast implementation and engineering skills that I gained through internship + full-time work at Google. Some of my industry work has included implementing probabilistic graphical models and complex algorithms from multiple research papers, reproducing results for various datasets from scratch.

I have previously worked on building the next-generation of language models - diffusion language models - which offer higher efficiency, reasoning, and controllability through a Cornell research lab. On the other end, I have also explored edge cases where certain optimizations may fail, seeing where models were unable to generalize well to new tasks (paper accepted). Lastly I have explored HCI and applying ML techniques to health (paper accepted) and privacy spaces, such as investigating federated learning (undergrad thesis).
